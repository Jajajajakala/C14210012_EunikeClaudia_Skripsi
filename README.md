# Gold Price Forecasting using Time Series & Machine Learning

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis project for the Business Information Systems program.

The project focuses on forecasting gold prices using time series analysis and machine learning models, and presenting insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The objectives of this project are:
- To analyze historical gold price data
- To build forecasting models (ARIMA / ARIMAX / Random Forest / XGBoost)
- To evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- To visualize results and insights in an interactive dashboard

---

## 🧠 Methods Used
- Time Series Analysis (ARIMA / ARIMAX)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Feature engineering (lags, moving averages, indicators)
- Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R²)
